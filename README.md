Thanks to Jarrod Millman, Matthew Brett, J-B Poline, and Ross Barnowski it would not have been possible without you guys.

Special Thanks to Matthew Brett(https://github.com/matthew-brett) for meeting us pretty much everday during finals week.

## Steps to be followed

### Downloading Data

Change Directory to the data directory `cd data`

`Please make sure that you have atleast 13GB of disk space before running make data, please make sure you have uninterrupted internet to download the 12GB of data`


## Navigating

The Makefile contains four commands: `clean`, `test`, `verbose`, and `coverage`. 

- `make all`: Downloads and validates the data and then performs all final
  analysis. Generates the final report, stored in the `paper` subdirectory.
  Please be aware that it runs make alalysis and make eda which can take upto 2hrs on
  a powerful pc.
  
- `make data`: calls downloader.sh which downloads who compressed folder and uncompressing it, that is all the data we need

- `make validate`: ensure the data is not corrupted

- `make eda`: generate figures from exploratory analysis and outputs the
  results in images/ directory

- `make analysis`: generate figures and results. Please note that in order to 
generate our results, 14 GB of data will be produced. 

- `make report`: build final report

- `make clean`: Removes all extra files generated when compiling code.
Commands and documentation for generating additional and supplementary work can
be found in various subdirectories. Please view their respective READMEs for
more information.

- `code`: Code files for all user-defined functions used for analysis, the
tests files for the functions, and scripts to run intermediate analysis.

- `data`: Data used for our analysis and tests can be downloaded and validated
here.

- `final`: Scripts to run the final analysis and generate all figures required
for the report and slides. The `make all` recipe in the present directory
essentially runs all the scripts in `final`.

- `images`: Stores all output figures generated by the analysis and eda scripts.
Figures required for the report and slides are cached for convenience, but may
also be reproduced. - `paper`: Files and instructions to generate the report. 

- `proposal`: Files and instructions to generate the proposal. - `slides`: Files
and instructions to generate the progress report and final slides.
